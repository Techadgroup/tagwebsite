                            include<br>
                            • Scalability: A scalable network should be designed to support increased traffic, users,
                            and
                            devices without compromising network performance or security<br>

                            • Availability: Availability refers to the network's ability to provide uninterrupted
                            service to
                            users. A highly available network should be designed with redundant components, backup
